# SAKATA INX - Network Access Configuration ✅

## ✅ COMPLETED: Network Access Setup

Your website is now fully accessible across all devices on your network! 

### 🌐 How It Works
- **Backend Server**: Configured to listen on `0.0.0.0:5002` (accepts connections from any network device)
- **Frontend Server**: Running with `--host` flag for network accessibility
- **API Configuration**: Dynamically detects network IP for seamless device switching

### 🚀 Quick Start Commands

#### Option 1: Start Both Servers Together (HTTP)
```bash
npm run start:both
```

#### Option 2: Start Both Servers with HTTPS
```bash
npm run start:both:https
```

#### Option 3: Start Manually
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend (HTTP)
cd backend
node server-with-routes.js

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
npm run dev:network
```

#### Option 4: Start Manually with HTTPS
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend (HTTPS)
cd backend
node server-https.js

# Terminal 2 - Frontend (HTTPS)
npm run dev:https:win
```

#### Option 5: Use Batch File
```bash
start-network.bat
```

### 📱 Access From Other Devices

Once servers are running, you'll see output like:
```
📍 Local: http://localhost:5173
📍 Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173
```

Other devices on your network can access:
- **Website**: `http://[YOUR_NETWORK_IP]:5173`
- **All features work**: News, Careers, Certificates, Admin Login, Search
